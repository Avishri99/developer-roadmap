### 1) Choose your language: C Sharp or C++

Focus on concepts such as,

+ Object-oriented programming using C++/C#
+ Working with events
+ Working and integrating with a frontend
+ Exception Handling
+ Multithreading

### 2) Learn Math need for Game programming

Below are some Math concepts that you should focus on,

* Algebra and Linear Algebra
* Trigonometry
* Calculus
* Discrete Mathematics

### 3) Pick a Game Engine: Unity or Unreal Engine
There are many game engines available such as:
* GameMaker
* Godot
* OpenGL
* Unity
* Unreal Engine

### 4) Learn about Game Mechanics, Designs and Arts
Game mechanics, which are the building blocks of gamification, are the rules and rewards that make up gameplay and create an engaging experience.

### 5) Learn Game physics and Animation
The ever-growing need for increased immersion and realism demands that the simulation of physics in the game world delivers predictable, realistic results in a very short amount of time. Thus, game physics and modern animation plays an important role.

### 6) Start developing 2D Games
Working on simple 2D games will help you clear concepts such as Game mechanics, game dynamics, and much more. Also, it will give you industry experience and polish your debugging skills.

### 7) Start working on 3D Game development
These days itâ€™s all about 3D games that are getting so much popularity. Thus, start learning how 3D games work, How to develop 3D games.

### 8) AI in Game Development
Artificial intelligence has been a growing resource for video games for years now. Most video games have various elements that are controlled by AI. Although AI continues to be used to bring video games to life, video games are now being trained to study their own patterns so as to improve their own algorithms, which is just one of many ways that AI is becoming more advanced.

### 9) Get started with Multi-player Game programming
Modern games are all about multi-players, thus it is necessary to understand how we can implement multiplayer programming. Connects such as network programming, multithreading are the important building blocks of this kind of game.
Thus, try getting hands-on and creating mini multi plates games and eventually polishing your skills.
